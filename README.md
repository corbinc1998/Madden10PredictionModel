# Madden 10 Fantasy Draft Simulation

This repository contains a **Madden 10 Fantasy Draft Simulation**, a project that records every CPU vs. CPU game in a Madden 10 fantasy draft league. All game results are tracked and stored, and the project has now evolved to include an **AI predictor** that uses historical results to predict future outcomes. We are currently in **Season 6**, with the AI updating its model weekly based on real results.

All games are streamed live and uploaded to YouTube, and **results are updated in real time on the web app**.
